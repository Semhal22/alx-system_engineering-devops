<h2>0x07. Networking basics #0</h2>
<p>This project covers the concepts of the OSI model, and then about network
types such as LAN, WAN ... Concept about the Internet is also part of this project. In light of the internet, it explains IP address, MAC address etc. Basically this project contains tasks in which most of them are answers to multiple choice questions based on the above concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0. OSI model</p>
What is the OSI model?

1. Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
2. The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
3. The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology

How is the OSI model organized?

1. Alphabetically
2. From the lowest to the highest level
3. Randomly

<li>
<p>1. Types of network</p>
What type of network a computer in local is connected to?

1. Internet
2. WAN
3. LAN

What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?

1. Internet
2. WAN
3. LAN
</li>
<li>
<p>2. MAC and IP address</p>
What is a MAC address?

1. The name of a network interface
2. The unique identifier of a network interface
3. A network interface

What is an IP address?

1. Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
2. The unique identifier of a network interface
3. Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks
</li>
</ul>
